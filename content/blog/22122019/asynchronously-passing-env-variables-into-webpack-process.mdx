This is my take when dealing with asynchronous passing env variables into webpack process.
It should keep your code maintainable and more readable

__1.__ Supposedly we are using ```cross-env``` to pass variables into webpack process.

``` bash
cross-env av=<value> mode=<development|production> webpack --config=<your-webpack-config-path>
```

```av``` is an arbitrary variable and it needs to have the value from a series of  asynchronous actions

__2.__ Now define ```stdou.js``` as a nodejs process in which output of this acts as a stdout to our webpack process

```js language=js
// require inspect to serialize the stdou to JSON format
// Normal stdout will be serialized in webpack process.env
const {inspect} = require('util');
(async function stdou {
	try {
		// Do some async here
		const stdou = await your_actions();

		// jsonify the output first, use inspect to keep JSON format
		// then console.log as node process stdou
		console.log(inspect(JSON.stringify(stdou)));
	} catch(err) {
		// Dont forget to catch errors! ;)
		console.log(err);
	}
})();
```

__3.__ Next, using ```xargs``` with ```{}``` placeholder to replace the value of our ```av```

```bash
node stdou.js | xargs -I '{}' cross-env av='{}' mode=<development|production> webpack  --config=<your-webpack-config-path>
```

The outpout from stdou.js process is piped to webpack env variables ```av```

__4.__ For example:

The output from stdou.js is:

```json
{
	"hash": "792391239"
}
```

It is now ```av``` value you passed into webpack process asynchronously

__5.__ Finally, calling ```process.env.av``` in your webpack config to use the value normally.
